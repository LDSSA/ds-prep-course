    "- Try to increase the Intelligence of the Computer Player. If you look at the code now (refer to the player.py file), the computer player is just a simple random choice. There are some simple rules that you can define that will increase the intelligence of the player. If you want to create a unbeatable computer player, please take a look on [this algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/tic-tac-toe-creating-unbeatable-ai-with-minimax-algorithm-8af9e52c1e7d). \n",
    "- When the game ends, you need to close the window and launch the game again. You can try to implement a strategy that allows you to restart the game. Take a look on how the quit functionality is implemented. Try to add a new [pygame event](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) that allows you to restart the game.\n",
